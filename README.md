# Scripts
miscellaneous scripts I've written, mostly in bash/python

| Script | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| auto-wallhaven | automatically download and preview/apply a random wallpaper from [wallhaven](wallhaven.cc). |
| rolldice | roll an arbitrary dice. Rolls 1d6 by default, but accepts arbitrary die in the form `<permutations>d<dice sides>`. |
| tput-values | output a table of every tput value from 0-256. Useful for prompt customization reference. |
| monitor-info | simplified monitor query for xorg display servers. Shows only selected values on active monitors. |
| hyprland-rotate | script to rotate the display on hyprland with support for rotating input devices as well. |
| git-url-swap | convert a local copy of a github repository's upstream URL between the ssh and http versions. |
| github-fetch | download the most recent release for a github repository by providing `author/repository` as an argument. Optional dmenu integration. |
